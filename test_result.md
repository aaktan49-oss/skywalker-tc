# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.

# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data.

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Successfully completed comprehensive testing of the site-wide notification system with 100% success rate (34/34 tests passed). AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION: Public endpoint GET /api/content/notifications accessible without authentication, all admin endpoints properly protected with 403 Forbidden for non-authenticated requests, admin endpoints working correctly with Authorization: Bearer <token> headers. NOTIFICATION CRUD OPERATIONS: Complete CRUD cycle tested successfully - CREATE notifications with all 6 types (announcement, news, update, maintenance, promotion, alert), READ operations for both public and admin endpoints, UPDATE notification content and status, DELETE notifications. DATA VALIDATION: All Pydantic model validation working correctly - missing required fields rejected with 422, empty fields rejected, all valid notification types accepted. TIME-BASED FILTERING: Public endpoint correctly filters notifications by time and status (active notifications within date range shown, expired/future/inactive notifications hidden), admin endpoint shows all notifications including inactive/expired. GLOBAL VS TARGETED: Successfully tested both global (isGlobal: true) and targeted (isGlobal: false) notification creation. CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED: Fixed SystemNotificationCreate model to include isActive field, fixed MongoDB query logic for time-based filtering using $and operator, implemented proper Pydantic validation for all endpoints. All notification system features are production-ready and fully functional!"

      message: "INFLUENCER COLLABORATION ENDPOINTS TESTING COMPLETED: ‚úÖ ALL ENDPOINTS WORKING PERFECTLY! Successfully completed comprehensive testing of influencer collaboration system as requested in Turkish review. ADMIN AUTHENTICATION: ‚úÖ Admin login with admin@demo.com / demo123 working correctly for portal endpoints (different from main admin system). COLLABORATION ENDPOINTS: ‚úÖ GET /api/portal/admin/collaborations successfully retrieving existing collaborations (found 1 existing), ‚úÖ Response format validation passed with all expected fields (id, title, description, category, status, createdAt), ‚úÖ POST /api/portal/admin/collaborations successfully creating new collaborations with Turkish sample data ('Test ƒ∞≈übirliƒüi', 'Bu bir test i≈übirliƒüidir', category: 'moda', budget: 5000, priority: 'high', maxInfluencers: 2), ‚úÖ Data persistence verified - created collaboration found in subsequent GET requests with correct data. MONGODB COLLECTION: ‚úÖ Collaborations collection verified and accessible - found 2 total documents after test creation. SAMPLE DATA TESTING: ‚úÖ All required fields from review request working correctly (title, description, category, requirements, budget, priority, maxInfluencers). ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Admin panel collaboration visibility issue was due to authentication mismatch - main admin system (admin/admin123) uses different user collection than portal admin system (admin@demo.com/demo123). Portal collaboration endpoints require portal admin authentication. SOLUTION: Use admin@demo.com / demo123 credentials for collaboration management in admin panel. All collaboration endpoints are production-ready and fully functional!"
