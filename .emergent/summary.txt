The trajectory chronicles the evolution of the Skywalker.tc application from a bug-fixing stage to a full-featured Content Management System (CMS) and digital marketing platform. The initial work involved resolving a critical authorization bug in the admin panel and fixing UI inconsistencies in the dark theme for the News and Portfolio sections.

Following these fixes, the project expanded significantly based on user requests. The core task was building out the CMS capabilities. This was done in phases:
1.  **Core CMS Extension:** Backend models (Pydantic) and FastAPI endpoints were created for Team, Testimonials, and FAQ sections. The frontend  component was heavily modified to provide a UI for managing this new content. These sections were then integrated into the public-facing site to display the dynamic content.
2.  **Notification System:** A site-wide notification system was implemented, allowing admins to create, schedule, and display global announcements.
3.  **SEO & Marketing Enhancements:** At the user's request, the news section was converted from a modal to individual SEO-friendly pages. A comprehensive suite of marketing tools was added, including dynamic meta tags via , fields for analytics/ad verification codes, a newsletter subscription widget, a WhatsApp chat widget, and a cookie consent bar.
4.  **Final Bug Fixes:** The user identified several new issues, including broken navigation on news detail pages, a UI glitch with the admin logout button, and a file upload error. All were successfully diagnosed and resolved.

The work concluded with the user requesting payment (Iyzico) and SMS (NetGSM) gateway integrations. The AI has just retrieved the integration playbooks for these services and is about to begin implementation.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React, React Router v6, Tailwind CSS, React Helmet (for SEO).
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), Pydantic for data modeling.
- **Database:** MongoDB with the  async driver.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- **Architecture:** Monorepo structure with separate frontend and backend applications.
- **Key Features:** Custom-built CMS, file upload system, dynamic SEO management, and integration points for third-party marketing and communication tools.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monorepo architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.

**Directory Structure:**


- ****
  - **Importance:** Defines all database schemas. It is the single source of truth for the application's data structures.
  - **Summary of Changes:** Extensively modified to support the full CMS and marketing features. New Pydantic models were added for , , , , and . The  model was expanded to include fields for SEO meta tags and analytics verification codes.

- ** & **
  - **Importance:** These files contain the core API logic.  was expanded to include CRUD endpoints for all new CMS entities (Team, FAQ, etc.). The new  was created to handle newsletter subscriptions and other marketing-related API calls, keeping concerns separated.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The central hub for all administrative tasks. It has become a very large and complex component.
  - **Summary of Changes:** Underwent massive expansion to include UI, state management, and API logic for managing Team, Testimonials, FAQs, Notifications, and the new Marketing/SEO settings. UI fixes were also applied to the sidebar layout to fix an overflowing logout button.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The main application entry point, handling routing and global component layout.
  - **Summary of Changes:** Modified to include the new route for  (). It was also updated to render new global components like , , , and .

- ****
  - **Importance:** A new, crucial component for SEO. It displays a single news article on a dedicated, server-routable page.
  - **Summary of Changes:** Created from scratch to fetch and render a single news article based on an ID from the URL, improving SEO over the previous modal-based approach.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The primary navigation component for the site.
  - **Summary of Changes:** The navigation logic () was updated to be context-aware. It now checks if the user is on the main page before attempting to scroll to a section, and navigates to the homepage if on a sub-page like the news detail view.

  - Deeper analytics integration (Heatmaps, A/B testing).
  - Enhanced user experience features (PWA, Live Chat).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The engineer is at the very beginning of implementing two new major features requested by the user, which are critical for the Turkish market: a payment gateway and an SMS notification service.

1.  **User Request:** The user explicitly rejected Stripe/PayPal and Twilio, requesting local alternatives: **Iyzico** for payments and **NetGSM** for SMS.
2.  **Action Taken:** The AI engineer successfully used the  tool to retrieve detailed, step-by-step integration guides for both Iyzico and NetGSM. These playbooks provide the necessary API endpoints, data models, and implementation logic.
3.  **Current State:** The work is paused immediately after retrieving these two playbooks. The next logical and planned action is to start the implementation by installing the required dependencies ( for Iyzico and  for NetGSM) into the backend environment and then proceeding to write the integration code as outlined in the playbooks. No code has been written for these integrations yet.
