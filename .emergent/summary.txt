The trajectory details the iterative development of the Skywalker.tc application, focusing on integrating Turkish-specific payment (Iyzico) and SMS (NetGSM) gateways. The initial phase involved creating backend infrastructure: new Pydantic models, FastAPI endpoints, and service modules. This was done in a mock mode as the user lacked API keys. During this process, the AI engineer debugged several issues, including Pydantic v2 syntax changes and incorrect assumptions about the  library's architecture, which required refactoring to a global configuration pattern.

Following successful backend testing (after fixing authentication and data persistence issues found by a testing agent), the focus shifted to the frontend. The user requested a UI in the admin panel for these new features, plus management for a Galactic Services section. This revealed a critical architectural issue: two separate, conflicting  components existed. The AI resolved this by modifying the application's routing in  to point to the correct, more feature-rich dashboard.

Subsequent work was driven by direct user feedback, leading to significant UI/UX enhancements for the payment and SMS management screens, making them more functional and intuitive. The final phase involved adding an API settings page, fixing data visibility for influencer collaborations and partnership requests by adding backend endpoints and seeding data, and fully integrating these sections. The work concluded with the user reporting three new issues, with the AI just beginning to investigate the first one: the contact form integration.

<product_requirements>
The project, Skywalker.tc, is a B2B portal and marketing website for a consultancy. The primary objective of this development cycle was to integrate Turkish-market-specific payment and SMS gateways, Iyzico and NetGSM, respectively.

**Implemented Functionality:**
- **Backend Integration:** Mocked, tested, and authenticated FastAPI endpoints for creating Iyzico payment links and sending NetGSM SMS messages.
- **Admin Panel UI:** A comprehensive admin panel was developed and refined to manage new features. This includes:
    - **Payment Management:** A UI to generate customer-specific payment links.
    - **SMS Management:** A UI to send targeted SMS messages and view history.
    - **Services Management:** CRUD functionality for the Galactic Services displayed on the homepage.
    - **API Settings:** A dedicated section for users to input their Iyzico and NetGSM API credentials.
    - **Influencer & Partner Management:** Sections to view and manage influencer applications and partnership requests, populated with seeded data.

**Problem Solved:**
The platform now has the complete backend and frontend infrastructure to support payment processing and SMS notifications, pending the input of live API keys. The content on the homepage's Services section is now fully dynamic and manageable from the admin panel.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), Pydantic for data validation and modeling.
- **Database:** MongoDB with  async driver.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based, with user role dependency injection in endpoints.
- **Third-Party Integrations:** Iyzico (Payment Gateway), NetGSM (SMS Gateway).
- **Development Pattern:** Iterative development based on user feedback, including bug fixing, UI/UX improvements, and feature expansion. Seeding scripts were used to populate data for development and testing.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.

- ****
  - **Importance:** Defines all Pydantic models for database collections and API requests/responses.
  - **Summary of Changes:** Heavily modified to add models for , , , , , and partnership requests. Corrected Pydantic v2 syntax ( to ).

- ****
  - **Importance:** The main FastAPI application file where all API routers are imported and included.
  - **Summary of Changes:** Updated to include new routers for payment, SMS, services, and updated portal endpoints.

- ** & **
  - **Importance:** These new files encapsulate the logic for interacting with the Iyzico and NetGSM APIs.
  - **Summary of Changes:** Created from scratch. The  was notably refactored to handle the  library's global configuration and was implemented with mock logic for development without API keys.

- ****
  - **Importance:** This is the primary, feature-rich component for all administrative tasks.
  - **Summary of Changes:** This file received the most changes. New sections, state management (), data fetching (), and complete UI components were added for Payment Management, SMS Management, Services Management, API Settings, and Partner Requests. It was the subject of significant iterative UI/UX improvements based on user feedback.

- ** & **
  - **Importance:** These files handle the main application routing.
  - **Summary of Changes:** A critical fix was made here. The  route in  was pointing to , which rendered a different, less-functional dashboard.  was modified to render the correct , resolving a major UI discrepancy.

- ****
  - **Importance:** The component that displays the company's services on the public-facing homepage.
  - **Summary of Changes:** The data fetching logic was updated to call the new  backend endpoint, making the homepage content dynamic and manageable from the admin panel.

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the issue where contact form submissions from the main site do not appear in the admin panel.
- Resolve the problem where influencer collaborations created by an admin are not visible in the admin panel.
- Implement a new user management system with three distinct roles: y√∂netici (administrator), influencer, and firma (company).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The previous engineer had just received a new set of requests from the user. The immediate task being addressed was the first item on that list: investigating why submissions from the website's main contact form are not appearing in the admin panel.

The trajectory ends with the AI engineer taking the first step to diagnose this issue by using the screenshot tool to visually inspect the contact form on the live website. The goal was to understand the form's structure, identify the fields, and prepare to analyze the network request that is triggered upon submission to trace the data flow from the frontend to the backend. No code changes have been made yet to address this specific problem. The engineer is in the initial reconnaissance phase for this new batch of tasks.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Analyze the browser's network tab when submitting the contact form to identify the target API endpoint and payload, then check the corresponding backend code to debug why the data is not being saved or displayed in the admin panel.
