The trajectory outlines the iterative development of a full-stack web application for a Trendyol consultancy named Skywalker.tc. The process began with a user request to build a landing page based on an uploaded PDF, with a universe or Star Wars theme.

The development started with a frontend-first approach, creating React components with mock data to quickly establish the visual design and user experience. Initial components included a Hero section, Services, and Header. The user's feedback drove the project's evolution, introducing significant new requirements. These included a logo, an influencer application portal, and an admin panel for content management.

Subsequently, the user requested more complex features: a customer registration and support ticket system with WhatsApp notifications, and a Team section featuring Star Wars characters. This led to the development of a FastAPI backend with MongoDB, including models for users, influencers, tickets, and team members. The backend implementation involved creating API endpoints for CRUD operations, authentication, and seeding initial data.

Throughout the process, multiple debugging cycles occurred. On the backend, a persistent  password hashing error required several attempts to resolve. On the frontend, issues like poor color contrast, missing components, and webpack compilation errors (Unicode characters, unterminated strings) were addressed based on user feedback and logs.

The final phase involved integrating the frontend forms with the backend APIs and scaffolding the UI for the admin and customer portals. The most recent user requests were to ensure responsive design, add a Scroll to Top button, and provide a demo of the admin panel, which is the current focus of the work.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a comprehensive, full-stack web platform for Skywalker.tc, a Trendyol consultancy. The application should serve as both a marketing website and a functional portal for influencers, customers, and administrators.

**Core Features:**
1.  **Public Landing Page:** A visually appealing, Star Wars themed website that showcases the company's services. It must emphasize profitability and ROI for clients, featuring sections for services, team (represented by Star Wars characters), testimonials, FAQ, and contact information. The company logo must be prominently displayed.
2.  **Influencer Portal:** A system for influencers to apply to the platform by submitting their name, contact details, and social media profiles (Instagram, TikTok). These applications must be manageable by an administrator.
3.  **Customer Management System:** Functionality for customers to register, log in, and create support tickets. The system should notify customers via WhatsApp when their tickets are answered.
4.  **Admin Panel:** A secure, backend-driven dashboard for administrators to:
    *   Manage all website content dynamically (e.g., services, team members, testimonials).
    *   Review, approve, or reject influencer applications.
    *   Manage customer support tickets.
    *   Add tracking codes for Google Ads, Analytics, and Meta.
5.  **Profitability Analysis Tool:** A future feature, inspired by melontik.com, to be built natively within the platform to provide financial analysis for clients.

The entire application must be responsive and mobile-friendly.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components.
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python web framework), Pydantic for data validation.
- **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL), accessed asynchronously via .
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with  for password hashing.
- **API Design:** RESTful API with a  prefix for all backend routes.
- **Development:** Full-stack architecture with a decoupled frontend and backend, managed by .
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a standard monorepo with separate  and  directories.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files:**

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance:** The main entry point for the React application. It defines the routing structure and assembles all the page components.
    -   **Changes:** It was heavily modified to import and render all the new sections (About, Services, Team, Influencer, Contact, Footer, etc.) and to add the route for the  panel.

-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance:** The main entry point for the FastAPI backend. It initializes the app, sets up middleware (CORS), connects to MongoDB, and includes all API routers.
    -   **Changes:** Initially a simple Hello World app, it was expanded to include routers from , , and  to handle all application logic, from influencer applications to team data fetching.

-   **/app/backend/models.py**:
    -   **Importance:** Defines the Pydantic and MongoDB data structures for the entire application. It's the source of truth for how data is shaped.
    -   **Changes:** It was created and later updated multiple times to add new models for , , , , and  as user requirements evolved.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/TeamSection.jsx**:
    -   **Importance:** A key component requested by the user to showcase the team using Star Wars characters, fetching data from the backend.
    -   **Changes:** This file caused multiple compilation errors due to Unicode character and string termination issues. It was rewritten entirely to fix the bugs and now correctly fetches and displays team data from the  endpoint.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/ScrollToTop.jsx**:
    -   **Importance:** The most recently created component, built to address a direct user request for a scroll to top button for better user experience.
    -   **Code Snippet:**

<pending_tasks>
- **Implement Melontik-like Profitability Tool:** Design and build the backend models, API endpoints, and frontend UI for the financial analysis feature.
- **Complete Customer Portal UI:** Build out the UI for customer registration, login, and the ticket submission/viewing system.
- **Provide Admin Panel Demo:** Demonstrate how the admin can log in and manage content. This requires connecting the admin UI components to the backend APIs.
- **Ensure Full Responsive Design:** Systematically review and fix CSS for all components to ensure the site is fully mobile-friendly.

<current_work>
The most recent task was to fulfill the user's request for a Back to Top button and a demo of the admin panel. The AI engineer has just finished creating the  component, which provides the button functionality. This component uses React hooks (, ) to conditionally render a button with a smooth scrolling behavior when the user scrolls down the page. The component is self-contained and ready to be integrated into the main application layout.

The immediate next step, which was about to be performed, is to import this newly created  component into the main  file so that it appears on all pages of the website. Following this, the plan was to address the user's request to see a demonstration of the admin panel.

<optional_next_step>
Add the  button to  to make it visible across the entire application.
